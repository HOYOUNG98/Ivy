Fill your database quickly (with random values..?)

## Introduction
This application does a simple job. As it receives a API url and schema for your model, it will fill your database for you! It 
is going to make random values everytime with the filter you provide. Currently, this application is still in a developing stage,
it only supports number and string field. Some supported filters are max and min for number and upper or lower case for strings.

For future plans, there should be handlers like Date, password, and even arrays and objects. Also, I will be updating with a valid
API call.

*It will never be made into a production mode since there people can be abusing this by using this application as a server.*
